3. **Navigate** through the available presentations using the provided links

### Running with a Local Server (Recommended)

For the best experience, especially when working with complex presentations, run a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using Live Server (VS Code extension)
# Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📝 Adding New Presentations

To add a new presentation to the project:

1. **Create a new folder** for your presentation:

   ```bash
   mkdir New-Presentation-Name
   ```

2. **Add your presentation files** to the new folder:

   ```bash
   New-Presentation-Name/
   ├── presentation.html
   ├── flow.html
   └── additional-files...
   ```

3. **Update the index.html** file to include links to your new presentation:
   - Add a new presentation folder section
   - Include appropriate links and descriptions
   - Update the styling if needed

4. **Update this README** to document the new presentation

### Example Structure for New Presentations

```html
<div class="presentation-folder">
    <h2 class="folder-title">
        <span class="folder-icon">🔧</span>
        New Presentation Name
    </h2>
    <div class="presentation-links">
        <a href="New-Presentation-Name/presentation.html" class="presentation-link">
            📖 Main Presentation
        </a>
        <a href="New-Presentation-Name/additional.html" class="presentation-link">
            ⚙️ Additional Content
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```

## 🛠️ Customization
